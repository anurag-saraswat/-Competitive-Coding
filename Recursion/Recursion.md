Recursion
----------

Recursion in Computer Science is a method where solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem.


Easiest Way to Approach to Recursion Problems
"Magical" Recursion Rule = Principle of Mathematical Induction(PMI)

1)Figure out the Base Case
2)Assume Sub Problems can be solved by recursion(automatically)
3)Using the sub-problems wrtite the answer for the current problem.
